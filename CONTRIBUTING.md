## Contribution procedure

The steps are quite standard in the GitHub community:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change or improvement to the 
   [issue tracker](https://github.com/migduroli/asr-cloud/issues) of this project.
2. Before submitting the issue where the new change is explained, please make sure this change is not being already developed or listed. You can always ask team members in case of doubt.
3. Please don't mix more than one logical change per issue. This would make the repository history hard to follow.
4. Coordinate with team members that are listed on the issue in question, as suggested in point 2. This will remove any potential redundancy, besides allowing for a better planning which should result in better code.
5. If your proposed change is accepted, fork the repo, develop and test your code changes.
6. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing.
7. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass. This is quite important to us, so please make your maximum effort in writing a 100% unit-tested code.
8. Create an example project where the new feature is used and explained in a Readme.md file.
9. Submit a a well documented pull request.
